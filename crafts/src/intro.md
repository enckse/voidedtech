Intro

I dabble in various crafting areas and post some of the outputs here. 
Some of the tools I use to develop patterns for crafting (mostly cross-stitching):

- [kxstitch](https://www.kde.org/applications/graphics/kxstitch/) for designing patterns from images/scratch
- [gxs](https://github.com/enckse/gxs) utilites to design simple patterns

As a software engineer I am utilizing some of my knowledge to build tools (e.g. pyxstitch) 
but, of note, cross-stitch patterns are a prime candidate for [reverse engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering).
If you find a completed pattern/image (and the size is reasonable)
you can create a pattern if it is not available for purchase, download, etc.
